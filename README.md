# 🧞‍♂️ Aladdin AI - Institutional-Grade Trading Intelligence

**Aladdin AI** is a next-generation algorithmic trading platform designed for the Indian Markets (NSE), Crypto, and Forex. 

Unlike traditional bots that rely solely on technical indicators, Aladdin uses a **Hybrid Intelligence System**:
1.  **Universal Transformer Brain:** A sophisticated Time-Series Transformer model (trained on 100+ assets) that understands general market physics, allowing it to predict prices for *any* stock, even ones it hasn't seen before.
2.  **Semantic Engine (RAG):** Uses Vector Embeddings (`MiniLM`) to "read" financial news and gauge market sentiment (Bullish/Bearish), preventing trades during high-risk news cycles.
